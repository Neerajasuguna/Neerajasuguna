# Hi, I'm Neeraja 👋  
**Java Backend Engineer @ Walmart Global Tech | Building scalable, reliable distributed systems | Aspiring Software Architect**

## 🚀 About Me  
I’m a backend engineer with experience in  designing, developing, and scaling production-grade microservices.  
I focus on building systems that are **resilient, observable, and optimized for performance**.

At work, I’ve solved large-scale engineering problems across inventory, dispute resolution, monitoring, and international expansion systems — consistently reducing latency, improving throughput, and automating workflows.

I am currently deepening my expertise in **system architecture, high-performance backend design, distributed caching, and API gateways** as I work towards transitioning into a Software Architect role.

## 📌 Featured Projects  

### 🔹 API Rate Limiter (Spring Boot + Redis)  
A production-grade rate-limiting service implementing:
- Token Bucket  
- Sliding Window  
- Sliding Window Counter 

Built with Redis for distributed counters, Spring Boot interceptors, and configurable per-endpoint rules. Designed to simulate API Gateway-level throttling with performance metrics and extensible rate-limit strategies.

### 🔹 Sorting Visualizer  
An interactive visualization tool demonstrating sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort, helping users understand algorithm behavior through animations.

### 🔹 Todo List Chrome Extension  
A minimalist productivity Chrome extension for adding, tracking, and organizing tasks seamlessly within the browser.
